text-guests
===========

A small program that allows users of the 
[Uplisting](https://uplisting.io/) property management system
to send texts to their guests, encouraging them to book directly
after their stays.

It relies on [TextMagic](https://textmagic.com/) to store its data
and to send SMS messages.

Contains a good start on Go API clients for 
[Uplisting](https://support.uplisting.io/docs/api) and 
[TextMagic](https://docs.textmagic.com/).
